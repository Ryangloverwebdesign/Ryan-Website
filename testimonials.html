I am staff with eXp and she was one of MANY realtors I corresponded with daily and I felt extremely comfortable as she and I communicated. I knew she was the best choice (for me) and selected Lillian to assist with my real estate needs. The absolute best part of all her qualities is her patience. I was certain as to where I wanted to reside for the month or 2 that her and I embarked but things changed on a personal level for me and my indecisiveness did nothing to alter her professionalism, her kindness and compassion. Lillian understood my situation. I was not just “a sale” or a client to Lillian but I was a person that she guided during the real estate process with patience and understanding!She is a gem and anyone is lucky to have her as their expert Realtor!</p>

            <p class="paragraph-10">Lillian was amazing and easy to work with. She was able to quickly find us tenants that were best suited for what we were looking for. Throughout the whole process she was very professional and walked us through every step. If you’re an owner or looking to rent I highly recommend working with her. Your experience will be just as pleasant as ours. Thank you Lillian!</p>

            <p class="paragraph-10">To Whom It May Concern, Lilan is an incredible agent who has worked with us for over a year to help us find a home that was right for our family. I have lived in Queens for over 30 years and raised a family with my wife in Ridgewood. Moving to Middle Village seemed like such an easy but daunting transition from Ridgewood. I felt that most agents would try to market and tactic in a way they would almost force a home on to me, even if it wasn’t a right fit emotionally or financially. Lilian’s standards for her clients are almost identical for her own. The amount of honesty and integrity that she would speak to is what lead me ot trust her for this new chapter of our life.</p>
